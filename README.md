# Thronefall-FreeCam-Mod
A Thronefall mod that adds camera zooming and freecam to the game!

Currently there are no customizable settings. Another modder is working on a universal solution for this so all your Thronefall mod settings can be in one place. Once that's working properly, settings are planned to be added.

# Controls
F-key: Hold to freely move the camera by moving the mouse to the side of the screen. Release to reset the camera onto your character.
Scrolling: Zoom the camera in or out.
Middle Mouse Button: Press to reset the camera zoom back to default.

# How to Run
Download BepInEx 5.4.21 and copy it into your Thronefall directory. Run the game once if this is the first mod you're installing. Inside the BepInEx folder, find the "Plugins" folder or create it. Download the FreeCam release and unzit the foldr into the plugins folder. Voila!
